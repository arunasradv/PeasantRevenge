# Introduction

### Lets make it better!

Thank you for considering contributing to PeasantRevenge. Your contribution will change peasants (and kings) lives for ever!

### Guidelines.

The mod only implements things related to peasant revenge. Npc should have the same play rules as player.

### What contributions does the mod need
- Bug fixes.
- Better dialogue lines.
> Maybe you feel, what npc or player should say something in different way. Maybe persuasion dialogue is needed somewhere.
- Better translations.
> Now it is google translated.
- Some dialogue lines are shallow and lack variations.

The mod has almost all main features implemented now. Bigger, not implemented, features are marked as "(not implemented)" in the Readme.md file.

Features what I'm going to develop by myself:
- "AI may try to encourage notable peasant to initiate the peasant revenge". I expect to complete this feature soon (in 1-2 months).
Features what I'm not planing to develop in near future, by myself:
- "Player try to persuade the hero after player is captured".
- "Hero let the other lord to decide criminal's fate".
- "relationChangeForPlayerWhenNotableExecutedTheCriminal" parameter.
- "Notable bribing effect should be temporary".

### What contributions I'm not looking for.
Code related features:

- "The code is a mess. Need to rewrite all".
- Dependency on other mods.
- Save-able mod module content (quests, classes, parameters...).

New events:

- Lord's revenge to notable peasant, due to peasant's past doings.
- Lord's revenge to other lord, because of past revenge event.

> Such events will expand the mod too much. And basically mod will need to be renamed to i.e. "Revenges". And other mods may have implemented same features already. If you do want these features, when you should fork this repository and/or create your own version of the mod.
